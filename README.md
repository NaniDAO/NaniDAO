Nani DAO is a progressive [*DUNA*](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/duna-for-daos/). Adopting the structure detailed in [*SF50*](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/duna-for-daos/), the provisions of the Wyoming Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) Act, as well as the existing [*UNA Act*](https://law.justia.com/codes/wyoming/2022/title-17/chapter-22/), Nani DAO provides its members with the benefits of greater privacy, limited liability protection, and therefore more autonomy over making collective decisions for the DAO by limiting the prospect of unexpected legal interference.
